# lk (lemme know) - Sends you a Message when a Command has finished (with success or failure status)

## Example

![](./objects/demo.gif)

To configure go to the `$XDG` base directory folder path (MacOS: `/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/rs.LK.LK/LK.toml`,  Linux: `home/#USER/.config/LK`) and adjust the configuartion file to the services you want to be sent a message to (supports email, MatterMost, and Twilio at the current time). 

Once done make sure your config file is set to `600` or `rw---` so you are the only one able to see and edit the file with passwords, and API tokens!!
